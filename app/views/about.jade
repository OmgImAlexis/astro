            | BitCannon aims to be as user friendly as possible while still providing robustness and the features you would expect. We hope the average user will use BitCannon to keep personal bittorrent archives, but we strive to produce code that can stand up to running a public mirror as well.
        h3 How To Use
        p Using BitCannon is simple. There is a search box on the front page that allows you to search for torrents that have been loaded into the database. You may also find torrents using the browse tab. The torrent decsription page contains torrent details and a magnet link, which will open your torrent client for downloading.
